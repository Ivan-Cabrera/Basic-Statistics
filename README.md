# Web definition
Proportionality and the linear relationship that exists between different variables. If the values of one variable are systematically modified with respect to the values of another, it is said that both variables are correlated.

Let's Suppose we have an "R" variable and an "S" variable. As R values increase, S values increase also. Similarly, when S values increase, R values are increased as well. Therefore there is a correlation between the R and S variables.
